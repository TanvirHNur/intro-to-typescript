In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.

The point variable is never declared to be a Point type. However, TypeScript compares the shape of point to the shape of Point in the type-check. They have the same shape, so the code passes.

The shape-matching only requires a subset of the object’s fields to match. */
